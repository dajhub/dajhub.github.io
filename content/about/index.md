A personal blog using the static site generator [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and the theme from [Papaya](https://www.getzola.org/themes/papaya/), which I have adapted.  For example, I didn't really need "Projects" so I've hidden them but I've added callouts.  Color theme **broadly** based on [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/). I've used Nord as a starting point but adjusted where it did not really work very well (e.g. callouts).
