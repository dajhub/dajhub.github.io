Display managers provide you with a graphical login for your Linux distrbution.  Below is an example of the [LightDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM) display manager which is on my current Arch install:

![LightDM-display-manager](lightdm.webp)

An alternative display manager is [slick-greeter](https://github.com/linuxmint/slick-greeter) which uses LightDM but is [Linux Mintâ€™s](https://linuxmint.com/) Cinnamon desktop own version.  There are some, including me, that believe it is a more attractive display manager than the default LightDM display manager.

## Installing Slick-greeter

To install slick-greeter on Arch via your terminal:

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S lightdm-slick-greeter
```

## Changing the Default Greeter Session

Once you have installed slick-greeter you need to change the default greeter session, which is LightDM.  In your terminal:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
```

Once opened, scroll down to the line [Seat:*]. About sixteen lines below this you will see a line which looks like:

```
greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter
```

The line needs to be changed to:

```bash
greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter
```

Save the file with the modification you have made using Ctrl+O.  To exit nano use Ctrl+X.

Next, as root open nano again

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/lightdm/slick-greeter.conf 
```

The file will not exist, so nano will create it.  You can then add the following lines (source: https://github.com/linuxmint/slick-greeter) to slick-greeter.conf.

```bash
# LightDM GTK+ Configuration
# Available configuration options listed below.
#
# activate-numlock=Whether to activate numlock. This features requires the installation of numlockx. (true or false)

[Greeter]
draw-grid=false
background=/usr/share/backgrounds/archlinux.png
```

The #'s mean that the options are not being used but can become active by uncommenting.  See the last two lines as an example. Change the "background=" to whatever background file you desire. Save the file as before with Ctrl+O and then Ctrl+X.

## The Result!!

After restarting your computer the new login screen looks as follows:
