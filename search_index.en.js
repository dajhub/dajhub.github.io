The window manager, bspwm, does not handle any keyboard inputs and a third party program, sxhkd, is needed in order to translate keyboard events to navigate around bspwm.\n\nMost of my keyboard shortcuts are the default from 'sxhkd'.  However, there are a few additions which have made navigation much easier for me.\n1. Rotate an application around the current desktop\n\n\nThe keys 'p' and 'o' can be changed for whatever you prefer - they just work for me!  If you use 'super + shift + p' this will move your windows in a clockwise direction around the desktop.\n2. Expand/contract a window by moving one of its side outward/inward\n\nThere is a command in 'sxhkd' which allows you to expand and contract a window but, for me, it feels cumbersome and counter-intuitive.  The original sxhkd keyboard shortcuts are:\n\nFor me a simpler method is as follows:\n\n3. Focus the next/previous desktop in the current monitor\n\nThis one took me a while to find but one which I really wanted.  It allows you to rotate through your desktops - in my case I have 5.
