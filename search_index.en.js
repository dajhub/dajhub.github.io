However, there are a few additions which have made navigation much easier for me.\n1. Rotate an application around the current desktop\n\n\nThe keys 'p' and 'o' can be changed for whatever you prefer - they just work for me!  If you use 'super + shift + p' this will move your windows in a clockwise direction around the desktop.\n2. Expand/contract a window by moving one of its side outward/inward\n\nThere is a command in 'sxhkd' which allows you to expand and contract a window but, for me, it feels cumbersome and counter-intuitive.  The original sxhkd keyboard shortcuts are:\n\nFor me a simpler method is as follows:\n\n3. Focus the next/previous desktop in the current monitor\n\nThis one took me a while to find but one which I really wanted.  It allows you to rotate through your desktops - in my case I have 5.

There are some, including me, that believe it is a more attractive display manager than the default LightDM display manager.\nInstalling Slick-greeter\n\nTo install slick-greeter on Arch via your terminal:\n\nChanging the Default Greeter Session\n\nOnce you have installed slick-greeter you need to change the default greeter session, which is LightDM.

If you do move to Unstable, it's probably best not to do it on a critical machine where you need guaranteed stability. With that said, the steps to move from Debian Stable to Unstable:\n\n\nUsing an editor such as nano, micro or vim open the Apt Sources file.

I have also used nano which is fine, but I have struggled to remember the shortcuts which do not always seem logical for me, e.g. Ctrl+K to cut, Ctrl+U to paste.  I have moved towards using micro as a text editor.  For me it has the right level of functionality and the shortcuts are more familiar to me, e.g. CTRL+s to save, CTRL+c to copy, CTRL+v to paste.  You can even easily choose different themes.\nWhile I have enjoyed using and learning micro, the biggest surprise I have had with the editor is that I was unable to copy text from micro into another external application.  Apparently micro has its own internal clipboard for copying and pasting, which cannot be used outside the editor.  I am currently using the Hyprland and Sway, which are window managers that use Wayland as a compositor.
